Loggel, Nang & Loggella RoadMap
===============================

Loggel: A logic modelling engine.
Nang: Natural-language processing engine.
Loggella: GUI application using Loggel and Nang to create logic models (circuits).

[LOGGEL] Translate natural language "When...condition...action" statement into functioning logic circuit.
^
|<- [NANG] Build and run Loggel circuit based on Nang story.
    ^
    |<- [NANG] Save/load Nang story (logic circuit) to/from xml.
        ^
        |<- <<<DONE>>> [LOGGEL] Save/load circuits to/from xml.
            ^
            |<- <<<ON HOLD>>> [SIRIL] Library for persisting data.

[LOGGELA] Write Nang story.
^
|<- [NANG] Use Loggel as an engine to construct a Nang story.
    ^
    |<- [NANG] Model "When...condition...action" logic with Loggel circuit.

[LOGGEL] Logging system - needs to allow for displaying useful info to user, but not
         flooding him/her with info. E.G. "Component referencing unknown circuit".
