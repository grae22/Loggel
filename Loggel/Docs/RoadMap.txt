Loggel, Nang & Loggella RoadMap
===============================

Loggel: A logic modelling engine.
Nang: Natural-language processing engine.
Loggella: GUI application using Loggel and Nang to create logic models (circuits).

[LOGGEL] Translate natural language "When...condition...action" statement into functioning logic circuit.
^
|<- [NANG] Build and run Loggel circuit based on Nang story.
    ^
    |<- [NANG] Save/load Nang story (logic circuit) to/from xml.
        ^
        |<- [LOGGEL] Save/load circuits to/from xml.
            ^
            |<- <ON HOLD> [SIRIL] Library for persisting data.

[LOGGELA] Write Nang story.
^
|<- [NANG] Use Loggel as an engine to construct a Nang story.
    ^
    |<- [NANG] Model "When...condition...action" logic with Loggel circuit.
